# House Price Prediction Model

This project is an implementation of a simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset.

## Project Description

The model predicts house prices by considering various factors such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the size of the living area. The project demonstrates use of Python's scikit-learn library to implement the Linear Regression model, and matplotlib to visualize the relationship between the actual prices and predicted prices.

The code is written following clean code principles - it uses meaningful names for variables and functions, is organized into logical sections with in-depth comments explaining each section for better readability and understanding.

## Getting Started
